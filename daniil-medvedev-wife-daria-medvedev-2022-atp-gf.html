Medvedev's theory will be tested again in<span class="tsp-dib tsp-lpns tsp-npp">&nbsp;Australian Open 2022 Finals against Rafael Nadal.</span></strong></p><p><strong>Daniil Sergeyevich Medvedev</strong> is a Russian tennis professional player. The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) has him ranked world No. 2 in singles with 8935 points, just behind<strong> Novak Djokovic</strong>, which he first reached on March 15, 2021. He has thirteen ATP Tour singles victories, including the US Open in 2021 and the ATP Finals in 2020. Medvedev became the first and only player to defeat the top three ranked players in the world en route to the year-end championship title with the latter victory. Medvedev also finished second in the US Open in 2019 and the Australian Open in 2021. He is currently in the semi-final in the Australian Open 2022 which he is playing tomorrow opposing <strong><span class="tsp-dib tsp-lpns tsp-npp">Stefanos </span><span class="tsp-dib tsp-lpns tsp-npp">Tsitsipas</span></strong>.</p><p>The Russian-born player has definitely put in a lot of effort to get to where he is now and he's had someone rooting for him from the start, though he didn't always realize it. <strong>Daria Medvedev</strong>, his now-wife, originally met the future tennis star in the most unusual of circumstances and yes, it involved tennis. On September 12, 2018, <a href=# rel=noopener>Medvedev</a> married Daria Chernyshkova, a Moscow State University graduate and former junior tennis star, in Moscow. In September 2019, he attributed his improved tennis achievements to his marriage.</p><h2><strong>Who is Daniil Medvedev's wife? When did Daniil meet his wife for the first time?</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2022/01/daniil-medvedev-wife-daria-medvedev-2022.jpg alt=daniil-medvedev-wife-daria-medvedev-2022 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Daniil Medvedev is married to his wife Daria Medvedev for over 3 years. They have been together for almost 8 years in 2022.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a></strong></p><p><strong>Medvedev</strong> is very private about his personal life, but he initially met his wife<strong> Daria</strong> in 2014. The couple married in September 2018, just before he competed for Russia in the Davis Cup. Daria is from Moscow, and studied journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. Surprisingly, Daria, like her now-husband, was a tennis player. She played throughout her young days and was expected to go pro before an accident prevented her from continuing in the sport. Daniil has previously stated that his wife's knowledge of the game is crucial to him.</p><p>Tennis brought Daria and Daniil together. Daria was just 12 years old when she met Daniil while eating at a cafe near the local tennis courts with her team. Daria said in a rare interview with Tatler Russia that she heard a racket being hurled there. Daria and her mom were curious about who that was and later knew it was Medvedev. Daria and her mom went to watch Medvedev's match together. The following match lasted three and a half hours. Both were extremely young at the time of that fateful meeting, but they began dating in 2014 after a few years apart. They relocated to Monte Carlo, Monaco, in 2017 and have remained there since.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Matteo Berrettini Girlfriend 2021 – Dating Australian Ajla Tomljanovic for Over 2 Years!</a></strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Daniil and Daria married in a low-key private wedding in 2018, just before the Russian athlete competed in the Davis Cup in September. Daniil made a <a href=# rel=noopener>rare statement</a> about his wife on their anniversary in 2021, shortly after winning his first career Grand Slam victory, the US Open. He said, "It’s the third anniversary for me and my wife. During the tournament, I couldn’t think of a present. So when I went in the final, I thought, I need to find a present fast. When I won, the only thing I thought, if I lose I have no time to have a present. So I have to win this match. I love you, Dasha"</p><p>His success was undoubtedly a cause for celebration amongst them—and there will undoubtedly be plenty more to come.</p><h2>Daniil Medvedev Faces Rafael Nadal in the Australian Open 2022 Finals</h2><p></p><p><strong>Medvedev</strong> had lost the first two sets, was low on confidence, and was one point away from exiting the Australian Open quarterfinals. Nearly a half-hour after saving a match point on his service in the fourth set, the US Open winner completed a 6-7 (4), 3-6, 7-6 (2), 7-5, 6-4 comeback victory. During his on-court TV interview and a later press conference, Medvedev expressed his feelings towards <strong>Djokovic</strong>.</p><p>He wasn't joking when he <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> that,&nbsp;"I was not playing my best, and Felix ... was all over me," Medvedev said. "I didn't know what to do so I (asked) myself, 'What would Novak do?' And I just thought, OK, I'm going to make him work. If he wants to win it, he has to ... fight to the last point."</p><p>In a replay of last year's semifinals at Melbourne Park, Medvedev recovered swiftly to face French Open runner-up <strong>Stefanos Tsitsipas</strong> on Friday. He was clearly the better play from the go and made a competition out of the game with Tsitsipas. The Greek national not able cope with the heavy shots managed to win just one set as Daniil won the Semi Final match 3 sets to 1 and set up a final with Rafael Nadal.</p><p>The Spaniard is chasing history in Melbourne, a Grand Slam where he hasn't been particularly efficient. With just 1 Australian title to his name, the Majorcan is trying to get his 21st overall grand slam. There is a no doubt a huge swath of fanbase in Melbourne will be for Nadal, so Medvedev will need to dig deep if he wants revenge against the greatest tennis player of all time.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p><a href=#><strong>Get to Know</strong></a> your favorite celebrities and <a href=#><strong>Explore</strong></a> relationship details of <a href=#><strong>ATP</strong></a> stars&nbsp;with <a href=#><strong>Celebs In-depth</strong></a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGibmqaZnrluucSdrZ6clat6uLXFnmSdmaKerm65xJ2tnpyVq3pzfJFrZJqsoGK0p3s%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./beyonce-renaissance-tour-set-list.html>&#171;&nbsp;Break My Soul, Run The World, Crazy In Love</a>
