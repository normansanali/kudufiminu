But bloggers, often comparing him to <a href=#>Sanjaya Malakar</a> from Season 6, noted how the judges' criticisms never seemed to affect the perpetually smiling Urban—or his chances at being saved week after week. He was dubbed "Teflon Tim," a nickname to which host Ryan Seacrest alluded during the March 30 broadcast. "I don't think it makes any difference whatsoever what we say," quipped <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a> the same night. "You're going to smile, the audience is going to vote for you, nobody cares, and you'll be here next week. So well done." As the controversy over Urban's lackluster performances grew, critics of the show began to fault the judges' commentary as "little more than displays of ego or thinly disguised bullying," and suggested Urban may be good for the show, because he put the judges in their place.</p><p>On September 18, 2013, Urban got married and on March 12, 2014 he revealed on his YouTube account that he and his wife are expecting their first child together.</p><p>On May 1, 2012, Urban released his first single, "Someday," off his upcoming debut album due for a 2012 release as a temporary free download and released the music video for the single in May 2012. He recently ran a Kickstarter campaign to raise money in order to record and release two new songs, "Perfectly You" and "Tears for Hallelujah." The new songs should be released around the beginning of 2014.</p><p>Urban tried out for the ninth season of American Idol at the Dallas auditions, and sang "Bulletproof Weeks" by <a href=#>Matt Nathanson</a>. <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a> questioned the song choice, but felt that there was "more to come out of [Urban]." The judges sent Urban through to Hollywood Week, where he was shown during the first night, singing "Come Back to Me" by American Idol seventh season winner <a href=#>David Cook</a>. Simon and <a href=#>Kara DioGuardi</a> both complimented the performance, although DioGuardi noted that it was "a little shaky." Urban was cut before the Top 24, but was called back after contestant Chris Golightly was disqualified from the competition for having lied about a past recording contract. Urban subsequently survived the semi-final eliminations and won a spot in Season 9's Top 10, securing a place on the 2010 American Idol summer concert tour. When he was asked by American Idol what his proudest moment was, he answered, "Handing out nutritional products to orphans in South Africa and Swaziland."</p><p>Urban went on a media tour on local FOX affiliates, in addition to planned appearances on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the Late Show with David Letterman, and The Wendy Williams Show. He has visited the If I Can Dream House. He was a part of the American Idols LIVE! Tour 2010 which started July 1, and ended on August 31, where he sang "Better Days" and "Viva La Vida". He also confirmed on MySpace that he will be releasing an EP. He then performed a live show during the half-time football game Duncanville High School v Garland high School, wearing a Duncanville jersey. He was given the key to Duncanville and his own day "September 3" in his home town, Duncanville, at the game from the Mayor.</p><p>On November 8, 2010 Urban began releasing a song a day to iTunes off his debut EP Heart of Me. On November 7, 2010 in a LIVE chat with the web site AiNow.org it was said that he will be moving to California during the week of November 7, 2010 to work on his acting career and music, and is working on booking TV Appearances to promote his album in California.</p><p>His first single "Heart of Me" was released online November 7, 2010, and to iTunes on November 8, 2010. In the following days (in order) "Wheels Touch Down", "You and I", "P.S.", "Lullaby", and "Blur" were put up on iTunes.</p><p>Timothy Joseph "Tim" Urban (born May 1, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter and actor who was the seventh place finalist on the ninth season of American Idol. Urban's debut album and EP titled Heart of Me was released on November 8, 2010 through iTunes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfqbauedSrmZqm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-is-barbra-streisands-net-worth-in-2023.html>&#171;&nbsp;What is Barbra Streisands net worth in 2023?</a>
