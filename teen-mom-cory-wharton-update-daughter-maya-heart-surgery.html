sweet video of his daughter Maya.</p><p>In the black-and-white clip, the <a href=#>Teen Mom</a> star tickled his daughter's stomach, causing her to giggle.</p><p>She smiled wide, showing some of her freshly cut teeth.</p><p>Maya still had an oxygen tube in her nose, stuck on with two heart-shaped pieces of medical adhesive.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="More Teen Mom">More Teen Mom</h2><p>The MTV dad shared in his caption: "Somebody is growing some teeth.</p><p>"Maya is doing great. Still on oxygen but her numbers are going up so it shouldn't be too long."</p><p>This is hardly the first update that Cory has shared about Maya as of late.</p><p>He recently opened up about the <a href=#>ups and downs of her recovery</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>HARD ROAD</h2><p>Earlier this month, Cory shared some serious news with fans about Maya.</p><p>He took to his Instagram feed on January 18 to reveal that <a href=#>he had "some GOOD news"</a> for fans.</p><p>The father of three posted a photo of himself and Maya, writing: "I have some GOOD news to tell you all WE finally got released from the hospital.</p><p>"I'm so thankful these past two weeks have been very up-and-down and have felt like a nightmare at times. But I always try to stay positive and being at the Children's Hospital for two weeks & seeing some families who have been up there for months or years and some maybe won't leave the hospital."</p><p>He went on: "I'm very thankful that we got released today. Maya had a successful Glenn procedure! But&nbsp;<a href=#>during recovery</a>, Maya had other plans. Maya's oxygen levels were lower than the doctors wanted it to be.&nbsp;</p><p>"6 days after her Glenn she ended up back in the operating room for a Cath lab procedure to hopefully fix what they thought was the problem."</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Teen Mom</a>&nbsp;dad continued: "It turned out that there was nothing to fix, which was great but it didn't fully explain the oxygen levels being so low. Trying to get her off the ventilator the second time around was a lot harder.</p><p>"After this roller coaster ride of emotions, I'm just happy & thankful to be home. Again just want to say thank you to everyone who supported us and prayed for us during this time, sorry if I didn't get back to your messages, I was a little stressed out."</p><p>Cory concluded his message with: "Love you all. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and that's what this did."</p><p>The post was accompanied by several snaps of the father-daughter duo.</p><p>The first pic showed them enjoying some time outside, with Maya smiling while wearing a polka dot outfit and pink headband.</p><p>Cory was looking lovingly at his daughter in the pic.&nbsp;</p><p>Another snap snowed them in the hospital.</p><p>Both the reality star and his infant daughter were looking directly into the camera with serious looks on their faces.</p><p>Maya had an oxygen tube in her nose and a pacifier in her mouth.</p><p>A third pic showed Cory pulling a silly face while he rested his head on his daughter.</p><p>Maya appeared to have her cheeks puffed out slightly.</p><p>Another snap showed the baby girl on her own in what looked like a hospital bed.</p><p>She smiled up at the camera, snuggling a fuzzy blanket with various tubes hooked up to her.&nbsp;</p><p>Cory also shared a photo of her from after one of her procedures.</p><p>She was seen laying asleep with tubes coming from her nose and arms and other equipment hooked up to her head.&nbsp;</p><p>In another photo, Maya cuddled with a stuffed animal as she lay in bed.&nbsp;</p><p>A similar snap showed her smiling as she held a smaller fuzzy friend to her chest.&nbsp;</p><p>Cory cradled his smiling baby girl in another photo in the batch.</p><p>She had on a purple outfit and a yellow bib.</p><p>The tot appeared to be in good spirits.</p><p>The MTV star gave fans a look at Maya's incision in one of his photos, posing with his tongue out as he cuddled close to his smiling baby.&nbsp;</p><p>In a final photo, Cory pinched her cheeks as she lay in her bed recovering.</p><h2>TAYLOR'S PAIN</h2><p>Cory's longtime girlfriend&nbsp;<a href=#>Taylor Selfridge</a>&nbsp;also recently shared an update on Maya.</p><p>She told fans online that&nbsp;<a href=#>she was "traumatized"</a>&nbsp;by the whole experience.</p><p>The ex-MTV star shared one clip that showed Maya laying in bed wearing a diaper as she kicked her legs and played with a light-up toy, with several tubes attached to her face and body.</p><p>Taylor captioned the short clip: "Still here. Maya had other plans for her recovery but she's doing well now.</p><p>"Cory and I are traumatized but it's fine. I'll update on everything when we get out of here," she added.</p><p>The second post was a close-up photo of Maya's face with her mouth slightly open as Taylor confirmed: "Maya got her first tooth during this stay," followed by a laughing face emoji.</p><p>A third post was another sweet clip of Maya in her hospital bed, surrounded by cuddly toys and grinning at her famous mom.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The song ME! by Taylor Swift was playing over the top and it was captioned: "I told her if she would just stop setting off her alarms we could go home."</p><p><a href=#>Fans had been concerned about Taylor and Cory</a>&nbsp;the week prior, noting that they had been radio silent on social media after revealing that Maya was going in for the operation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/i-good-news-tell-finally-789455319-1.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/prayers-maya-teen-mom-fans-788283305.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/teen-mom-cory-whartons-girlfriend-784539419-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYmmCeoGTaKuenZ5iurC5jJymq7FdrLWivtOopWatoJmutbGMnZiun5ipsrN5zJqwmmWYmq6zwIysrKuflafGcA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-crazy-story-of-edmund-hillarys-hunt-for-the-yeti.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Crazy Story Of Edmund Hillary's Hunt For The Yeti</a>
