She's done amazing work on screen, and her <a href=#>relationships with the MCU cast</a> off camera has certainly lent a hand in things translating well to what fans enjoy in each Marvel outing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Earlier this year, the star took part in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and if <a href=#>her time with Marvel is actually over</a>, then she made sure to end things with a Big Bang.</p><p>Olsen made news recently when she dished on why she hasn't actually seen her latest Marvel romp, and we have all the details surrounding that below.</p><h2 id=elizabeth-olsen-is-a-major-star>Elizabeth Olsen Is A Major Star</h2><p>During the 2010s, actress Elizabeth Olsen ventured into Hollywood looking to make a name for herself. The actress, who is the younger sister of the iconic Olsen twins, has been a massive success since getting into the business, and while the Olsen name has surely helped, she's done a wonderful job in the movies she's landed in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After several notable credits, things really turned around for OIsen in 2014, as she appeared in both Godzilla, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Those two movies were huge hits, and suddenly, her career was ready to take off.</p><p>While she has done a number of films in the years since, Olsen has largely focused her time on playing Wanda Maximoff in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. She's been a primary player in the franchise since Age of Ultron, and just last year, she kicked off Phase Four with WandaVision. That show set the stage for the next crop of projects, and it showed glimpses of the Multiverse.</p><p>Olsen's most recent offering heavily featured the Multiverse, and it took her character in an entirely new direction, one that some people weren't too thrilled with.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Praise Elizabeth Olsen For Defending Scarlett Johansson’s ‘Black Widow’ Lawsuit Against Disney</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-recently-starred-in-39-doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-39>She Recently Starred In 'Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness'</h2><p>Earlier this year, Elizabeth Olsen starred alongside Benedict Cumberbatch in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, one of the most anticipated MCU movies of all time. The film, which was directed by Sam Raimi, was hyped from day one, and it was a monster success at the box office.</p><p>Globally, the film was able to gross <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over $950 million</a>, making it one of the biggest films of the year. It didn't earn he same type of critical praise that films like Spider-Man: No Way Home earned, but enough people enjoyed what the movie did, noting the cameos and the darker tone as highlights.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, the movie marked what could be Olsen's last appearance in the franchise. Time will tell, but fans are hoping that Wanda comes back for more MCU action soon.</p><p>Despite being a major factor in the film, Elizabeth Olsen has gone on record saying that she never watched the movie. In fact, she even opted against watching the screener that the studio sent to her so that she could watch it at home.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘Doctor Strange Sequel’: Marvel Fans Disappointed That Elizabeth Olsen Will Reportedly Be The Villain</a></span></p><h2 id=olsen-didn-39-t-watcher-her-screener>Olsen Didn't Watcher Her Screener</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Olsen</a>, "I haven't seen it still. I’m not one of those. I’m like one of those people who likes to study something so I can figure out how to make it better. No, I had a cold when we had the premiere and I didn’t want to sit through it. I did have a cold. Because I was here and you gave me that spray, it was fabulous," she told Jimmy Fallon.</p><p>The actress then revealed that she was given a screener to watch it, but that there was something in her screener that she found too distracting.</p><p>"And so I asked them to send a copy so I could watch it, and was, like, it had my name on it and it had the time that I was watching it, and I didn’t want to watch it like that. So my name would be on it and the exact time and date. It was just distracting," she continued.</p><p>Most people would have geeked out to get a screener for a major Marvel movie, but as Olsen pointed out earlier, she's not one to go back and study her own movies. Because of this, that screener was either tossed, or it's just chilling in her house waiting to be watched by someone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Twitter Is Rooting For Elizabeth Olsen Following The Upcoming Primetime Emmy Awards</a></span></p><p>Doctor Strange in the Multiverseof Madness was a massive hit that a number of people loved, so maybe there's a chance that the actress will go back and give the movie a watch at least once.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Kate Winslet Fans Celebrate Best Actress Emmy Win While Elizabeth Olsen Fans Fume</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpaGqlq%2BmwMdmpqWrlaN6s7HVnpilnZRixKnFjKyfnmWUnrGvwIywmK2bmGK1pr6MpqylrJmrsrO%2FxGamn2WdlrGvsdKsZKybopqyr7HRaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./chelsea-deboer-kids-husband-family-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Has Three Daughtes And A Son</a>
