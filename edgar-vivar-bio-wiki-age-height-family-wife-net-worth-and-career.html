He toured the United States with some of his plays. This gave him vast experience in the acting field. In the year 1970, Chespirito needed a robust person to play “Señor Barriga” (“Mr. Beliarge” in Spanish) and Ñoño in his upcoming Televisa production of El Chavo del 8, and Vivar was hired for the job.</p><p>Both shows became major international hits, allowing Vivar to become known beyond Mexico and to tour all over Latin America, Spain as well as once again, the United States. Also, he made an attempt at becoming a telenovela actor, participating in his co-star Florinda Meza’s production, Alguna vez Tendremos Alas (Someday, we will have wings).</p><p>His weight caused him serious heart-related trouble after the half-hour Chespirito productions were over in the year 1980 (it is believed that his temporary absence from the show may have been weight-related as well as was explained that his character, el Botija, had gone to a weight loss clinic.) In the year 1992, he left the hour-long Chespirito program briefly for therapy at a weight-loss clinic. He lost a great amount of weight, which helped save his life. He kept touring the countries where Chespirito shows were kept on television as re-runs after the show was over.</p><p>In the year 2006, Vivar starred in the movie Bandidas as a bank manager. He also co-starred in a telenovela made in Argentina, Amarte Así, that became a major success in South America, Spain as well as the USA. Recently he had a role in the most recent production of Guillermo del Toro El Orfanato, filmed in Spain and released in October 2007. The same year, he voiced Auguste Gusteau in the Latin-American version of Disney-Pixar’s Ratatouille. He later voiced Dug in Up</p><p>In the year 2008, she underwent gastric bypass surgery at a clinic in Colombia and has lost approximately 165 pounds. Following his surgery, he has become an advocate for healthy living, particularly for overcoming obesity.</p><p>Following his weight loss surgery, Vivar retired all of his Chespirito characters, stating that due to his weight loss, they were no longer appropriate. He would, however, reprise the voices of Señor Barriga as well as his son Ñoño for an episode of the animated Chavo, the only cast member from the original series to do so.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-edgar-vivar></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Édgar Vivar</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-edgar-vivar></span><span>Who is Édgar Vivar?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Édgar Vivar is a Mexican actor who was born as Édgar Ángel Vivar Villanueva.
