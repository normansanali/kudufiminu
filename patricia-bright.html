We wish her the best of luck in her future endeavors.</p><h2><span id=Patricia_Bright-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Patricia Bright- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Patricia Bright, born Patricia Otegwu, was born and raised in South London, England. Her parents are Nigerians who moved to England before she was born. Moureen is her sister’s name. Her father is a businessman, while her mother stays at home with her children.</p><p>Her early childhood was marked by remarkable events, such as her father’s visa expiration, which resulted in his deportation to Nigeria. Patricia and her sister remained at home with their mother. As a result, her mother was forced to look for work in order for the family to survive financially. Fortunately, her father was able to return and obtain British citizenship.</p><p>Patricia’s early life reveals her to be an industrious and ambitious lady. She began working at the age of 16 and has been doing so ever since. She used to work in a retail store, distributing catalogs and taking orders. After that, while in junior college, she worked at a clothes business that specialized in bridesmaids’ outfits.</p><p>The university she attended is not indicated, but she earned a bachelor’s degree in Chemistry, Biology, and Psychology, which is an interesting subject. As her name implies, she was brilliant.</p><p>Following that, she sought to get a master’s degree in fashion industry marketing, which she swiftly abandoned. This is after being interested in hairstyling. She then opted to switch her master’s degree to a master’s degree in finance and accounting.</p><p>Patricia relocated to Manchester for her internship at Meryll Lynch, which lasted five years. She earned self-confidence throughout this time because she was once a timid girl. She was thinking about becoming a YouTuber at the time.</p><h2><span id=Patricia_Bright-_Relationship_Boyfriend>Patricia Bright- Relationship, Boyfriend</span></h2><p>Patricia has a lovely personal life as well. She met Mike, who would later become her husband, during her internship at Manchester. Mike had previously saved her from an accident, and their relationship had since taken off. Mike is a social media celebrity and YouTuber.</p><p>After five years of amazing dating, the couple decided to tie the knot, which they did in March 2012. The pair then went on their honeymoon to Mauritius, East Africa. It’s worth noting that they had a brief breakup owing to a long-distance issue, but it didn’t kill their love for each other because they quickly reconnected.</p><p>After four years of blissful marriage, the couple welcomed their first child, Grace, and welcomed their second child, Nova, in 2019. To this day, the family lives together.</p><p>We think there have been no previous signs of any past partnerships because there have been no previous indications of any previous relationships documented. We wish them the best of luck.</p><h2><span id=Patricia_Bright-_Professional_Career>Patricia Bright- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Patricia’s YouTube experience began while she was interning at Meryll Lynch. A friend persuaded her to go forward with it. She wasn’t paying attention to it at first because she was working. However, after leaving her work and marrying, she concentrated on a full-time career.</p><p>She began by sharing beauty tips and trendy items. Later on, she decided to perform make-up tutorials, which she did carefully, reviewing and posting videos of many types of make-up, including well-known brands. Brands such as Fenty Beauty, Kylie Cosmetics, Too Faced, Bobbi Brown, and MAC.</p><p>Her channel, Britpop Princess, began to earn a lot of popularity, and as a result, her subscribers and viewers have grown in number throughout the years. Her YouTube account currently has over 2.6 million subscribers, indicating a sizable fan base.</p><p>Patricia has a second channel called ‘The Break.’ In this one, he tells stories about finances and related financial problems, while in another, ‘Britpoplife,’ she makes vlogs about significant events in her life, as well as storytime videos.</p><p>Aside from that, she launched her own items, which she sells on her website, in response to requests from her subscribers.
