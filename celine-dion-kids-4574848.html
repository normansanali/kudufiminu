industry. After kicking off her French-language singing career as a teen in the 1980s, Celine made her English-language debut in 1990 with Unison, which has since been certified gold and included the No. 5 hit, ‚ÄúWhere Does My Heart Beat Now.‚Äù Perhaps her most recognizable song is ‚ÄúMy Heart Will Go On,‚Äù which was included in the soundtrack of 1997‚Äôs iconic and record-breaking cinema masterpiece, Titanic. Since then, she has ventured into the acting world while still releasing music. In Feb. 2023, she announced her new romcom with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Priyanka Chopra</strong> </a>and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sam Heughan</strong> </a>called Love Again.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sending out lots of love this Valentine‚Äôs Day from me, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@priyankachopra</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@SamHeughan</a>.

Unfortunately, these spasms affect every aspect of my daily life, sometimes causing difficulties when I walk and not allowing me to use my vocal cords to sing the way I‚Äôm used to,‚Äù the Canadian-born artist said in a Dec. 2022 Instagram <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Luckily, Celine has the support of her fans and friendly to lift her sprits as she deals with the rare diagnosis. Celine had<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> three boys</a> with her former manager and husband, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ren√© Ang√©lil</strong>,</a> whom she was married to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>until he died</a> in 2016 at age 73.

The rapper admitted to the<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Montreal Gazette</a> at the time that he kept his music on the down-low until it became popular on the site. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of messed up, honestly,‚Äù he told the publication. ‚ÄúI played it to her for the first time [on Wednesday]. I just felt like keeping it on the low. But she loved it. She was just kind of stunned at first, because she‚Äôd never heard anything from me. It was kind of a weird conversation: ‚ÄòMa, I‚Äôm No. 1 and No. 2 on the charts right now.‚Äô She was like: ‚ÄòWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me first?‚Äô But she‚Äôs very supportive of my passion for this.‚Äù However, RC potentially decided music wasn‚Äôt his future, as he seems to have since deleted his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Soundcloud account</a> as Big Tip.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>RC lives a fairly private life and only has three posts on his Instagram account, which boasts 90,0000 followers. He has not posted since Dec. 2021 and lists himself as an ‚Äúentrepreneur‚Äù in his bio.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Regardless of what he does, his mother seems in complete awe of him. The ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Your Angel‚Äù singer shared a<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> throwback photo of RC as a newborn</a> for his 21st birthday in Jan. 2022 and gushed about how proud she is to be his mother. ‚ÄúWe gave you life‚Ä¶ Thank you very much for giving us the wonderful gift of becoming your parents. Since that day, I‚Äôve been thriving as I watch you grow. Your intelligence, your generosity, your courage, and your great sensitivity never cease to move me,‚Äù she penned. ‚ÄúWe guided you from our dreams, by holding your hand. Keep exploring and above all, listen to your heart knowing that you are always carried by our love, so that now your own dreams can come true.‚Äù</p><h2>Eddy Ang√©lil</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Celine-Dion-Kids-Everything-To-Know-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>Nearly 10 years after Ren√©-Charles was born, the ‚ÄúAll By Myself‚Äù singer faced problems trying to conceive again and even suffered a miscarriage. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs priceless. So you know what? We had a miscarriage. We tried three more times. It did not work,‚Äù she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ABC News</a> in Feb. 2010. ‚ÄúWe are trying again for the fifth try. It‚Äôs aboard right now. All aboard. We‚Äôre just trying this one to give [RC] a sister or brother. It would be extraordinary to try and make this love of the family grow more.‚Äù</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>After a long period of trying, Celine announced that she gave birth to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>twins <strong>Eddy&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>Nelson</strong> </a>in an Oct. 2010 post on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her website</a>! She named Eddy after her producer, <strong>Eddy Marnay</strong>, who had produced her first five albums. ‚ÄúHe was like a father to her,‚Äù a representative told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE </a>in 2010. ‚ÄúEddy is a major influence in both C√©line and Ren√©‚Äôs lives.‚Äù</p><h2>Nelson Ang√©lil</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>Celine‚Äôs other son was named after revolutionary and former South African President&nbsp;<strong>Nelson Mandela</strong>, whom the singer had met when she performed in his home country. ‚ÄúRen√© said that in just the few minutes they were able to spend with him, they were impressed by the human being he is,‚Äù Celine‚Äôs representative told PEOPLE shortly after the twins‚Äô birth.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>In Oct. 2020, Celine wished Nelson and his twin brother a very <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>happy birthday</a> on her<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Instagram</a> page. ‚ÄúNelson and Eddy, you have been bringing so much joy, love and laughter into our lives every single day for the past 10 years.
