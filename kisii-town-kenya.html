Abundant rainfall and very fertile soils have made Kisii Kenya one of the most productive agricultural areas in Kenya.</strong></p><p><strong>Between 70 and 80 percent of the land can be cultivated. Since 1989, the Gusii as a single ethnic group have occupied the Kisii, Gucha, Bobasi, Masaba and Nyamira districts of southwestern Kenya.</strong><span id=more-197552></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kisii-town-climate></span>Kisii Town Climate<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kisii is located in western Kenya, on latitude: 0° 41′ 0 S and longitude: 34° 46′ 0 E. The town is a driving distance of 309&nbsp;km (192&nbsp;mi) from the capital city of <strong>Nairobi</strong>, located east-southeast, on Class B3 all-weather road. Other major urban center’s distances from <strong>Kisii town</strong> are <strong>Kisumu City</strong> which is 114&nbsp;km (71&nbsp;mi) to the northwest; Nyamira at 23&nbsp;km (14&nbsp;mi) to the immediate north, Keroka at 25&nbsp;km (16&nbsp;mi) to the east, Kericho at 101&nbsp;km (63&nbsp;mi) to the northeast, <strong>Kilgoris</strong> at 46&nbsp;km (29&nbsp;mi) to the southeast, <strong>Narok</strong> at 165&nbsp;km (103&nbsp;mi) to the east and Migori to the south-west 67&nbsp;km (42&nbsp;mi) which otherwise connects the town to the Kenya /Tanzania border at Isebania town a further 31&nbsp;km (19&nbsp;mi) south.<br>Kisii town enjoys a highland climate. It generally receives rain all year round thanks to its positioning in the Lake Victoria, lake basin and the heavily foliaged Kisii highlands. Due to its unique positioning within hills, Kisii town has never experienced flooding.<br>The city frequently receives thunderstorms and some thirty people in Kisii die each year from lightning strikes because of their frequency and because many of the area’s structures have metal roofs.<br>For more information click here</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=history-of-kisii-town></span>History of Kisii&nbsp;Town<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kisii town was originally known by the Gusii people as Getembe. It was later named Bosongo, and it is believed to have originated from ‘Abasongo’ (to mean the White people or Whites) who lived in the town during the colonial times. The town was originally established by British soldiers who were being forced to retreat from Lake Victoria by heavy gunfire from German soldiers’ gunboats during the Great War in the early 20th century. Later, Kisii was chosen to be the District Headquarters of the larger South Nyanza and Kisii region.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=economic-activities-in-kisii-town></span>Economic Activities in Kisii&nbsp;Town<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The economy of Kisii town is derived from commerce and agriculture. Crops and fruit cultivated around the area include<strong> maize</strong>, managu, <strong>beans</strong>,<strong> bananas</strong>, pineapples, avocados, <strong>pawpaws </strong>etc. Kisii town is dotted with tall commercial buildings and is ever-bustling with activity. Kisii is the fastest growing town in western Kenya thanks mainly to its high population, political stability and general tranquility. New businesses are steadily being installed.<br>Smaller components are in food processing, health care, education. Although it has a few industrial activities, it has the potential for larger agro-based industries due to its location in a rich agricultural area. Soapstone quarrying takes place near the town around Tabaka, southwest of the town and a few miles off the Kisii-Isebania Road. Coca-Cola has a bottling and distribution plant in the Kisii municipality. The town hosts large supermarket chain stores, e.g. Uchumi, <strong>Nakumatt, </strong>Naivas, and Tuskys. Besides, it hosts 19 commercial banking and financial institutions’ branches. These include the long-existing</p><li><strong>Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB)</strong></li><li><strong>Barclays Bank</strong></li><li><strong>National Bank</strong></li><li><strong>Post Bank</strong></li><li><strong>Co-operative Bank </strong>(two branches)</li><p>Newer entrants in the banking sector such as <strong>Equity</strong> <strong>Bank</strong>, I&M Bank, <strong>CFC Stanbic</strong> <strong>Bank</strong>, Credit Bank, <strong>Kenya</strong> <strong>Women</strong> <strong>Finance</strong> <strong>Trust</strong>, Family Bank,<strong> Chase</strong> <strong>Bank</strong>, Eco-Bank, Diamond Trust Bank,<strong> K</strong>–<strong>Rep</strong> <strong>Bank</strong> and others have launched new branches taking advantage of the large population and the positioning of Kisii as an increasing commercial hub town. Mwalimu Cooperative Savings & Credit Society Limited (Mwalimu Sacco), the largest Sacco in Kenya, maintains a branch in Kisii.<br>Moreover, like many of Kenya’s major urban centers, there is an influx of numerous other business ventures such as the hospitality sector with hotels, bars, restaurants, sports pubs, among other commercial activities.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-to-get-to-kisii-kenya></span>How to get to Kisii&nbsp;Kenya<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Public transportation, which is operated privately, is available throughout the town. A good example is private-owned taxis (matatus), taxi cabs and ‘boda-boda’ (motorcycle taxis) as an alternative to privately owned vehicles. Kisii town has one of the most organized bus stations and public transport systems in the country. Buses and matatus are not allowed inside the town.<br>Air service to Kisii is minimal. However, chartered flights mainly from Nairobi’s Wilson Airport transport passengers to Kisii’s Suneka Airstrip situated 9&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;mi) southwest of the town centre. The facility is underused, but many of the residents especially businessmen, local politicians, and tourists use it for convenience.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=night-clubs-and-nightlife-in-kisii-town></span>Night Clubs and Nightlife in Kisii&nbsp;Town<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><li>Alfrose Bar</li><li>Embassy Bar</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=education-institutions-in-kisii-town></span>Education Institutions in Kisii&nbsp;Town<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><li>Nyachwa High School – Boys Boarding</li><li>Kereri Girls&nbsp;Secondary School – Girls Boarding</li><li>ST.Lawrence&nbsp;Kiong’ongi&nbsp;Secondary School – Mixed Day</li><li>Bishop Charles&nbsp;Mugendi Secondary School – Mixed Day</li><li>Our Lady Of Victory Nyambera Dok Secondary School – Mixed Day</li><li>Nyaura Deb Secondary School</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tourism-and-tourists-attractions-in-kisii-kenya></span>Tourism and Tourists Attractions in Kisii&nbsp;Kenya<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There are potential tourist attractions sites like Tabaka soapstone, river kuja among others which need to be exploited. Hence there is need to build tourist hotels especially in Tabaka and provide proper publicity.<br>There are no registered game parks in the County but some geological sites such as Nyangweta Forest, Ritumbe Forest and Ibencho offer good tourist sites if well exploited.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=languages-spoken-in-kisii-town></span>Languages Spoken in&nbsp;Kisii Town<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Kisii language, Ekegusii, is a Western Bantu language. It is common to name a child after a deceased person from the father’s clan for the first name, and one from the mother’s clan for the second name. Children may also be named for a recent event, such as the weather at the time of the child’s birth. Some common names refer to the time of migrations. For example, the woman’s name Kwamboka means “crossing a river.” Talking about personal feelings is prohibited. Hence, questions about a person’s mental state are answered with statements about physical health or economic situation.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=religion-in-kisii-kenya></span>Religion in&nbsp;Kisii&nbsp;Kenya<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before Christianity was introduced to the Kisii people, they believed in one supreme god who created the world but did not interfere directly in human affairs. Instead, interference was caused by ancestor spirits (ebirecha), witches, and impersonal forces. The Kisii tribe believed that displeased ancestor spirits were responsible for disease, the death of people and livestock and the destruction of crops.<br>Today, most Kisii claim to be followers of some form of Christianity. A Roman Catholic mission was first established in 1911 and a Seventh Day Adventist mission in 1913. There are four major denominations in Kisiiland: Roman Catholic, Seventh-Day Adventist, Swedish Lutheran, and the Pentecostal Assemblies of God.<br>Although churches are very active, some non-Christian beliefs continue to influence the lives of most Gusii. If afflicted by misfortune, many Kisii visit a diviner (abaragori) who may point to displeased spirits of the dead and prescribe sacrifice. In addition to abaragori, who are usually women, various healers also exist. Abanyamoriogi (herbalists) use a variety of plant mixtures for medicines. Indigenous surgeons (ababari) set fractures and treat backaches and headaches through trepanation (needles). Professional sorcerers (abanyamosira) protect against witchcraft and retaliate against witches. Omoriori, the witch smeller, finds witchcraft articles hidden in a house.<br>Witches (omorogi) can be men or women, but are usually women. They are believed to dig up recently buried corpses to eat the inner organs and use body parts for magic. Among the Gusii, witchcraft is believed to be a learned art handed down from parent to child.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rites-of-passage-among-the-kisii-people></span>Rites of Passage Among The Kisii People<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The most important Kisii ceremonies are associated with initiation and marriage. Initiation involves genital surgery for both sexes: clitoridectomy for girls and circumcision for boys. The ceremony is supposed to train children as social beings who know rules of shame (chinsoni) and respect (ogosika). Girls are initiated at the age of seven or eight, and boys a few years later. Initiations are gender-segregated, and the operations are performed by female and male specialists. Afterward, there is a period of seclusion for both genders.<br>Funerals take place at the dead person’s homestead, and a large gathering is a sign of prestige. Christian elements, such as catechism-reading and hymn-singing, are combined with the traditional practices of wailing, head-shaving, and animal sacrifices. Before burial, the corpse is dissected in order to determine whether the death was caused by witchcraft. The Kisii tend to fear the spirit of a dead person. They believe the dead person may be angry for having died and may punish survivors. Therefore, sacrifices must be made to the spirit of the dead person to appease it.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=people-of-kisii-town></span>People of&nbsp;Kisii Town<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kisii town&nbsp;has a sizeable number of Indian, Kikuyu and other communities who are also involved in trade although the Kisii people&nbsp; seem to be more prominent. However, the Indians have recently bought several properties from the Gusii which they are developing into supermarkets and highrise buildings at the center of the town.<br>Over the past few years, the town has experienced tremendous growth especially with the entry of firms in the town. The town now hosts large supermarket chains e.g.Tuskys and Nakumatt. Most banks e.g.Equity, Eco-bank and K-Rep have also launched new branches in the town taking advantage of the large population and &nbsp;positioning of Kisii as a center town</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hotels-in-kisii-town></span>Hotels in Kisii&nbsp;Town<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1-dallas-inn></span>1.&nbsp;Dallas Inn<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Dallas Inn<br>Dallas Inn is a luxurious hotel situated next to the business district in Kisii, County.
