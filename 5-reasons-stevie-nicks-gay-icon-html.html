The fact that anybody loves my music makes me feel very good, because this is what I do.”</p><p id=par-5_53>She went on to describe why her friends, including her gay friends, are so important to her. “I didn’t get married; I don’t have kids. I have lots of godchildren, but it is just me and my dogs,” Nicks said. “And then I have my straight friends and I have my gay friends.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Stevie-Nicks-18.jpg><h2 id=h-2-stevie-nicks-has-compassion-for-people-in-the-closet-and-talks-about-how-she-would-come-out-if-she-was-gay><strong>2. Stevie Nicks has compassion for people in the closet and talks about how she would come out if she was gay</strong></h2><p id=par-6_26>Nicks has shown empathy for gay people who haven’t come out. “The idea of carrying that secret around would have killed me,” she told Out Magazine.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_46><a href=#>The “Landslide” singer</a> has also talked about whether she would come out if she were gay. “If I were gay, the second that I knew, I would have said, ‘OK, everybody, this is how it is, and either you still like me or I don’t care.’”</p><p id=par-8_69>She encouraged her gay fans to be open with their loved ones. “I think that if you are gay, you just have to say ‘It’s great!’ And hopefully you will find a great relationship. And hopefully all the straight people will find a relationship. And hopefully all the people like me who don’t care about having a relationship will continue to not care and just have a great dog.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-3-the-night-of-1-000-stevies-indisputably-makes-stevie-nicks-a-gay-icon><strong>3.

They love my clothes and my fashion and my songs, and they all go to it and play my music and lip-synch!’” said Nicks.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_53>“One day I’m going to show up, and they are not going to know it, because I’m going to be dressed as the best Stevie ever,” she continued. “I will be unrecognizably fantastic until I go up on stage and take the mic and burst into ‘Edge of Seventeen’ and blow everyone away.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-4-she-appeared-in-the-lgbtq-friendly-tv-show-american-horror-story><strong>4.

And she appeared as herself in season 3 of AHS, boldly embracing the decades-long accusations that she is a witch.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_37>“In his own way, though, Ryan writes about misfits,” Nicks said of the show (via the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LA Times</a>). “He and Brad, they write about people that don’t fit in.

Stevie Nicks is a gay icon because she is authentically herself</strong></h2><p id=par-15_21>Nicks has been very open and honest about her battles with addiction, her romantic life, her weight, and mistakes she’s made.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-16_23>Her authenticity encourages fans to be themselves, too. And she looks out for fans by sharing the negative parts of her life story.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-17_54>For example, Nicks said she hopes to help others by speaking about her history of drug abuse. “Try to let it be an epiphany for you, [the] 18-year-old person that is doing a lot of coke and smoking heroin and taking ecstasy and is on a dead-end road to hell,” she told Out Magazine.</p><p id=par-18_55>“I want anybody who hears a doctor say, ‘Would you like me to write you a prescription of Klonopin?’ to get up and run out of the room screaming and take the air out of that doctor’s tires.
