But, to many, Rae's silence sends a very clear message.</p><h2 id=what-did-addison-rae-39-s-father-do>What Did Addison Rae's Father Do?</h2><p>In June 2022, multiple publications reported that Lopez had been cheating on Addison Rae’s mother, Sheri Easterling. The news was seemingly confirmed when a young woman confessed to Page Six that she had been romantically involved with Lopez. The woman in question is 25-year-old Renée Ash.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>All Of Addison Rae's Achievements In 2021, Explained</a></span></p><p>Renée Ash shared details of the alleged relationship with Page Six, telling the publication that she was led to believe that things between Lopez and Easterling were over at the time and that he was dedicated to his relationship with her. "He told me that we were going to be together and have babies together," she said. She has also claimed that during their time together she was introduced to members of his family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/addison-rae-family.jpg><p>She believed their relationship was "real," adding, "He told me a story of his marriage that convinced me that they were apart and in the process of getting a divorce." But this was not the reason she ended their relationship!</p><h2 id=how-did-monty-lopez-rsquo-s-affair-end>How Did Monty Lopez’s Affair End?</h2><p>Renée Ash claimed the relationship started in March 2022 and the former couple had been introduced by a mutual friend. However, she ended things after reports emerged that Lopez had been contacting other women on social media and in person. She also saw footage of him with another woman when he was out partying. "I loved him and I believed him," she told Page Six. "When I found out about the other young girls, my heart broke."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Addison Rae’s Dad Exposed For Having Affair With Girl Her Age</a></span></p><p>Ash was hurt by Lopez's actions and chose to make this public, however, his daughter, Addison Rae, has stayed silent on the subject. Rae typically shares a lot of her life with the public, and to some, her silence is a response on its own because she has not reached out to defend her father and his actions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/addison-rae.jpg><p>It was also reported that when footage emerged of him with another woman, <a href=#>Rae unfollowed her father on social media</a>.

The pair first married in 2004, but according to E! News, they later divorced and remarried in 2017. Rae also gave an interview with Seventeen magazine in 2020 and the publication reports that her parents "were on-and-off for most of her childhood."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Addison Rae’s Mom Is Dating Yung Gravy (& Her Dad Reacts)</a></span></p><p>In a somewhat unexpected twist after the alleged affair, Easterling appeared to have moved on with rapper Yung Gravy and the pair stunned everyone when they showed affection at the MTV VMAs on Aug. 28, 2022. However, People reports that their "history dates back even further." It was, however, a short-lived romance, with them splitting in October of the same year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, Lopez appears to currently be in a relationship with Renée Ash and their social media accounts are filled with photos of them together, looking very loved up. They may be enjoying their rekindled relationship but not everyone is happy with this pairing. Evidence of this can be seen in the comment section of the photos he posts, and it is clear fans are not happy that he has moved on from his family. There are several comments comparing Ash to his ex-wife. There is also a notable age difference between the pair; Lopez was born Nov. 24, 1975, and as mentioned earlier, Ash is in her mid-20s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Addison-Rae.jpg><p>So, how did they get back together when it seemed that Renée Ash was done with the relationship for good?</p><p>In November 2022, the couple decided to give a joint interview to Page Six, in which Lopez stated that his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">divorce from Easterling had already been finalized</a>. "What I can do from here on out, I can move forward," he said. "In Louisiana, it’s real easy, it’s a lot different. You have to figure, we’ve been separated for over two years now."</p><p>Lopez also commented on his rekindled relationship with Ash, saying, "Honestly, I just don’t want to miss an opportunity with someone that I really care about." Ash weighed in, telling the publication that they were taking things slow, although it was reported that Lopez wants to get engaged.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How would Addison Rae feel about a new stepmom?
