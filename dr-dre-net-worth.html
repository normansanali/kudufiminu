However, stand by for an update, as Forbes magazine assesses that Dr. Dre earned $620 million in 2014-15, largely as a result of selling ‘Beats’ to Apple for a staggering $3 billion, which constitutes the highest earnings in one year for any entertainer, ever.</p><h3>Dr. Dre Net Worth $850 Million</h3><p>Dr. Dre was educated at Centennial High School, then Fremont High School both in Los Angeles, but was never a great student, and so missed out on an apprenticeship at Northrop Aviation. Subsequently, Dr. Dre started his career as well as his net worth accumulation being a DJ in the club named ‘The Eve after Dark’. Later Dr. Dre collaborated with ‘Ruthless Records’, an American record label founded by Gangsta rapper <a href=#>Eazy-E</a> and N.W.A. In 1992 Dr. Dre released his debut single, ‘Deep Cover’, also known as ‘187’, and which features <a href=#>Snoop Dogg,</a> also making his first appearance on record. Soon, Dr. Dre increased his net worth with ‘The Chronic’, his debut solo studio album released on his own record label ‘Death Row Records’, which received generally positive reviews from music critics. In 1994, the songs ‘Nuthin’ but a ‘G’ Thang’ and ‘Let Me Ride’ were nominated at the 36th Grammy Awards, where Dr. Dre won the Best Rap Solo Performance, and ‘The Chronic’ with G-funk sound dominating became a cultural phenomenon.</p><p>In 1996, his second album called ‘Dr. Dre Presents: The Aftermath’ was released. Although it added to Dr. Dre’s net worth and was certified platinum, it received mixed reviews and was not amongst the year’s most commercially successful releases. His following album ‘2001’ reached second place on the US Billboard 200 chart, as after the first week 516,000 copies were sold. Despite being criticized for his lyrics, ‘2001’ was still well evaluated by music critics and was loved by listeners, to the extent that as of July 2013 the album grossed seven million copies sold in the US alone.</p><p>Following the success of ‘2001’, Dr. Dre increased his net worth producing songs and albums for other artists. He worked with <a href=#>Eminem</a>, <a href=#>Mary J. Blige</a>, rapper <a href=#>Eve</a>, <a href=#>Gwen Stefani</a> and others. ‘Detox’ is stated to be Dr. Dre’s final studio album which has also added much to his net worth as it was very successful. During the whole of Dr. Dre’s career, the growth of his net worth has been assisted by winning six Grammy Awards – three of them for his production work – and two MTV Awards. In addition to this, Dr. Dre has been rated as the second richest personality in the American hip hop scene by Forbes; however, see above!</p><p>In his personal life, Dr. Dre fathered a son in 1981 with Cassandra Joy Greene, who was raised by his mother, so that Curtis Young first met his father when he was 20 years old, and became a rapper called Hood Surgeon. In 1988, Dr. Dre fathered Andre Young Jr., whose mother was Jenita Porter. Later, Dr. Dre dated singer <a href=#>Michel’le</a>, and they have a son named Marcel. In 1996, he married Nicole Threatt, and they are the parents of a son, Truth, and a daughter Truly. These liaisons may be surprising, as Dr. Dre has been accused of assault by several women, particularly during the 1990s, but any charges resulting have been settled out of court.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjsLC5jp2pZpyimnqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p></div><div id=links><a href=./drake-announces-2024-its-all-a-blur-tour-big-as-the-what-with-j-cole.html>&#171;&nbsp;Drake Announces 2024 Its All a Blur Tour-Big As the What?
