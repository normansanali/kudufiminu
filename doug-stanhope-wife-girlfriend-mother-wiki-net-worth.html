followed, he was invited to cast in veteran comedian Chris Rock’s 2014 film.&nbsp;</span><span>Top five.&nbsp;</span><span>In the film, he played a supporting role as a police officer.</span></p><p><span>In 2013, Doug launched his self-titled podcast which he recorded from his home in Arizona.&nbsp;It was eventually aired by the All Things Comedy Network the following
