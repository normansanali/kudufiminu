Starring an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ensemble cast of British actors</a>, they enchanted millions of fans all around the world and brought the story of the Boy Who Lived to those who had never read the original novels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The likes of Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, and Robbie Coltrane&nbsp;all put in memorable performances, bringing the magical characters to life on screen. However, even though there were few complaints about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">casting of the <i>Harry Potter</i> movies</a>, fans have speculated on what the franchise might have been like if other actors had taken on certain roles.</p><p>Some of these choices might have even made for a better experience, as the actors better fit the physical attributes and personalities of the characters.</p><h2 id=robin-williams-as-the-mischievous-peeves><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Robin Williams As The Mischievous Peeves</span></h2><p>Although Robin Williams <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">expressed an interest in playing Hagrid</a> in the <i>Harry Potter</i> series, we think he would have suited another role. Peeves the poltergeist was cut entirely from the movie adaptations. Yet, Williams could have brought the mischievous character to life perfectly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alec-guinness-as-the-wizened-professor-dumbledore><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Alec Guinness As The Wizened Professor Dumbledore</span></h2><p>Before his death, Alec Guinness was widely regarded as one of the finest actors of his generation. He had also already played a wizened and old mentor in the <i>Star Wars</i> original trilogy as Obi-Wan Kenobi. He would have brought grace and a sense of calm to the part of Dumbledore.</p><h2 id=tim-roth-as-no-nonsense-alastor-moody><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Tim Roth As No-Nonsense Alastor Moody</span></h2><p>Tim Roth is probably best known for his appearances in films such as <i>Pulp Fiction </i>and <i>Reservoir Dogs.</i> Yet, this experience as a tough, no-nonsense criminal would have been perfect for the gritty Alastor Moody. The auror would have definitely been someone not to mess with Roth playing him.</p><h2 id=naomi-watts-as-the-the-dark-narcissa-malfoy><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Naomi Watts As The The Dark Narcissa Malfoy</span></h2><p>According to reports, Naomi Watts was actually approached to play Narcissa Malfoy in the <i>Harry Potter</i> movies. Unfortunately, her agent turned the role down before it got to the actor to consider. Just imagine how the actor would have performed the part if she had accepted it.</p><h2 id=carey-mulligan-as-the-brave-tonks><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Carey Mulligan As The Brave Tonks</span></h2><p>Carey Mulligan is probably best known for her work in shows such as <i>Doctor Who</i> as well as the likes of <i>Pride & Prejudice</i> and <i>Bleak House. </i>Her physical characteristics match up well as Tonks and she would bring a more reserved and quiet aura to the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-driver-as-severus-snape><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Adam Driver As Severus Snape</span></h2><p>While Alan Rickman put in a masterful performance as Snape, he is not the only actor who could play the anti-hero. Adam Driver is a much better age fit for the character and has shown he is capable of playing dark, troubled but ultimately confused characters in the past with his work in <i>Star Wars.</i></p><h2 id=tom-hardy-as-the-savage-fenrir-greyback><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Tom Hardy As The Savage Fenrir Greyback</span></h2><p>Fenrir Greyback really did not have much of a role in the films outside of a few token appearances, whereas he was a more present antagonist in the books. Allowing Tom Hardy to play the character would add some much-needed savagery and make the villain much more fearsome.</p><h2 id=martin-freeman-as-the-mild-mannered-arthur-weasley><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Martin Freeman As The Mild Mannered Arthur Weasley</span></h2><p>Although there was nothing wrong with the original actor for Arthur Weasley, Martin Freeman would still be an excellent choice. After all, he is mild-tempered and funny, as shown by his role as Bilbo Baggins in <i>The Hobbit</i>,&nbsp;but also stern and powerful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sophie-turner-as-the-fierce-ginny-weasley><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Sophie Turner As The Fierce Ginny Weasley</span></h2><p>Sophie Turner has already played one young redhead on television, portraying Sansa Stark in the hit <i>Game of Thrones</i> television series. That makes her the perfect choice for Ginny Weasley, as she is more than capable of portraying a strong female character.</p><h2 id=tom-hiddleston-as-the-sniveling-lucius-malfoy><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Tom Hiddleston As The Sniveling Lucius Malfoy</span></h2><p>Tom Hiddleston is another actor who could have appeared in the <i>Harry Potter </i>series. He has shown he is capable of playing slick villains, such as Loki in the MCU, and would be a better age fit for the head of the Malfoy family.</p><h2 id=henry-cavill-as-the-handsome-cedric-diggory><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Henry Cavill As The Handsome Cedric Diggory</span></h2><p>Henry Cavill usually portrays strong, brave, and handsome characters in films. In fact, his most notable role is probably the Man of Steel himself. He auditioned for the role of Cedric Diggory but was unsuccessful, despite the fact that he appears to fit the part incredibly well.</p><h2 id=james-mcavoy-as-the-tortured-remus-lupin><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>James McAvoy As The Tortured Remus Lupin</span></h2><p>Like many other characters in the films, the actor playing Remus Lupin is much older than he should be. A more appropriate choice would have been James McAvoy. The actor is closer in age to the book version of Lupin and could pull off the disheveled appearance of the professor easily.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=judi-dench-augusta-longbottom><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Judi Dench Augusta Longbottom</span></h2><p>Augusta Longbottom was only shown very briefly in the <i>Harry Potter</i> movie adaptations. She plays a much larger role in the novels and Judi Dench would be a great actor to play the part in the movies. After all, she could be a stern but loving grandparent who is also a powerful witch.</p><h2 id=sean-bean-as-the-anti-hero-sirius-black><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Sean Bean As The Anti-Hero Sirius Black</span></h2><p>Sean Bean has played practically every type of character during his career, from heroes such as Ned Stark to villains in <i>James Bond</i>. This gives him the necessary range to appear both as a mad criminal and the brave Sirius Black in <i>Harry Potter</i>. Of course, the character’s early death also fits his stereotype of always dying.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Harry Potter Fan Theories More Interesting Than What We Saw In The Movies</a></span></p><h2 id=kate-winslet-as-the-ghostly-helena-ravenclaw><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kate Winslet As The Ghostly Helena Ravenclaw</span></h2><p>There have been a few rumors that the producers for the <i>Harry Potter </i>movies approached Kate Winslet for a role in the franchise. This part was seemingly Helena Ravenclaw, who holds the key to finding the legendary diadem that is also one of Voldemort’s Horcruxes. She would have brought grace to the part and accurately portrayed her beauty from the books.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=andy-serkis-as-the-dangerous-mad-eye-moody><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Andy Serkis As The Dangerous Mad-Eye Moody</span></h2><p>Andy Serkis is perhaps best known for his motion-capture work, but he is also an accomplished actor on his own. He already has experience playing rough and ready characters, such as Ulysses Klaue in the MCU, and could give a good representation of Mad-Eye Moody from the novels.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Harry Potter Rumors We Hope Are True (And 5 We Don't)</a></span></p><h2 id=tilda-swinton-as-the-mysterious-professor-trelawney><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Tilda Swinton As The Mysterious Professor Trelawney</span></h2><p>Tilda Swinton seems like the perfect actor to portray Professor Trelawney. She has an otherworldly quality to her that would suit with the mysterious nature of the Divination teacher. However, Swinton is unlikely to want to appear in the series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">due to her distaste of boarding schools</a>.</p><h2 id=hugh-grant-as-the-useless-gilderoy-lockhart><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Hugh Grant As The Useless Gilderoy Lockhart</span></h2><p>Few actors in recent times have quite as much charm or are as dashing as Hugh Grant. It is precisely these qualities that would make him the ideal actor to portray the vain but handsome Gilderoy Lockhart in <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.</i></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Things That Should've Made It Into The Harry Potter Movies</a></span></p><h2 id=ian-mckellen-as-the-headmaster-professor-dumbledore><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ian McKellen As The Headmaster Professor Dumbledore</span></h2><p>Ian McKellen has already shown that he is capable of portraying wizards exceptionally well. In the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> movie adaptations, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">veteran actor played the role of Gandalf</a>. This gives him the experience and demonstrates that he could easily pull off the look and personality of the character.</p><h2 id=benedict-cumberbatch-as-the-evil-voldemort><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Benedict Cumberbatch As The Evil Voldemort</span></h2><p>Benedict Cumberbatch has emerged as one of the most in-demand actors in the world over the last few years. As well as being able to portray heroes and villains alike, he has a certain quality and striking appearance that would allow him to accurately <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">portray the dark lord himself.</a></p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lord Voldemort: 20 Unnerving Secrets About His Past</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnKyfp8Buw8eoZLCnpaGxbrTAr5xmmpWau26z0Z6YrWWZo3qprdGrsGaon6nBpr6O</p></div><div id=links><a href=./esports-news-mrbeast-explains-why-he-couldnt-run-his-recent-feastables-ad-as-a-super-bowl-commercial.html>&#171;&nbsp;7 million dollars was a lot of $, MrBeast explains why he couldnt run his recent Feastables</a>
