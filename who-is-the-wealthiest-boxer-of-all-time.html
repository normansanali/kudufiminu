Over the years, many boxers have achieved great success both inside and outside the ring. While the sport has witnessed numerous talented athletes, there is one question that often arises among fans and enthusiasts: Who is the wealthiest boxer of all time? In this article, we will explore the lives and careers of some of the richest boxers in history, taking into account their earnings, endorsements, and business ventures.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Floyd Mayweather Jr.</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Floyd Mayweather Jr., often referred to as "Money," is considered one of the greatest boxers of all time and also the wealthiest.

He signed a deal with Salton, Inc. in 1994, granting them the exclusive right to use his name and likeness for the product. The endorsement proved to be highly lucrative, earning Foreman an estimated $200 million in total. His success as a businessman has secured his position as one of the wealthiest boxers of all time.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Oscar De La Hoya</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Oscar De La Hoya, a former professional boxer, is not only known for his boxing achievements but also his successful business ventures.

His good looks, charisma, and talent made him a fan favorite.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>De La Hoya's financial success came from various sources. In addition to his boxing career earnings, he founded Golden Boy Promotions, a successful boxing promotion company. Under his leadership, Golden Boy Promotions has organized numerous high-profile fights and signed lucrative television deals.

He has also been involved in politics, serving as a senator in the Philippines.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Pacquiao's earnings from his boxing career have been substantial, with his fights against Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Oscar De La Hoya being particularly lucrative. However, his wealth is not solely derived from boxing. Pacquiao has ventured into various business ventures, including real estate, endorsements, and a professional basketball team in the Philippines. His diversified income streams have contributed to his overall wealth, making him one of the richest boxers of all time.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>While boxing is often associated with physical prowess and athletic achievements, the sport has also created opportunities for boxers to amass significant wealth.
