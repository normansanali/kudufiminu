31-34 loss after teammate Walker Little accidentally stepped on him.</p><p>Less than 48 hours later, Lawrence addressed the media on Wednesday without a walking boot and said he felt "a lot better".</p><p>"I'm thankful it's not a worse injury than what I thought on the field," Lawrence said.</p><p>Jags head coach Doug Pederson has refused to rule out starting Lawrence this Sunday.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE NFL">READ MORE NFL</h2><p>Lawrence said: "If I can be out there and be myself for the most part, then I'm going to be out there."</p><p>The <a href=#>Jags</a> slipped to 8-4 after Monday's loss but remain in first place in the AFC South.</p><p>Lawrence has started all 46 possible games since being drafted No. 1 in 2021, which is tied for the third-longest active start streak among quarterbacks.</p><p>For his first couple of seasons in the <a href=#>NFL</a>, Lawrence was known as much for his majestic hair as his on-field exploits.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in NFL</h2></p><p>The Jags signal caller's golden locks&nbsp;have been a talking point ever since his time at Clemson.

Yet still it was his voluminous head growth that people remained fixated on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/12/ccc_1091jpg-JS864278770.jpg><p>"I guess I shouldn't be surprised at this point when I get questions about my hair, but I am," Lawrence said before the draft. "I guess I thought maybe people would be used to it. I mean, I've had it for a while now."</p><p>A high school student, who looked strikingly like Lawrence, becoming a TikTok sensation certainly helped the QB's celebrity profile.</p><p>As did the constant comparisons to various pop culture figures, like GQ, who likened him to Fabio Lanzoni, the retired cover star of&nbsp;romance novels.</p><p>Others compared Lawrence to Chris Hemsworth's Thor character from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it was his 'Sunshine' nickname that stuck with him throughout high school and into the pros.</p><p>Although you'd be forgiven for thinking the moniker was given to Lawrence for his warm and radiant disposition, the nickname is actually a nod to the iconic sports film 'Remember The Titans', when QB Ronnie Bass was called 'Sunshine' after showing up to his first practice with a flowy long blonde head of hair.</p><p>"Yeah, I've heard 'Sunshine' pretty much my whole life," Lawrence once explained.</p><p>Fast forward to present day and Lawrence's hair is still a subject of great interest around the league.</p><p>The 2022 Pro Bowler recently joined <a href=#>Peyton</a> and Eli Manning on their Manningcast for the New York Jets vs <a href=#>Los Angeles Chargers</a> game where he was asked about that other great head of NFL hair belonging to Justin Herbert.</p><p>"Trevor, last year, Justin Herbert said your hair was more impressive than his," Manning said.</p><p>"Justin also said that he does it and I quote, "put that much effort into it". It seems like he's implying that you work too hard on your hair. Now, I don't like to start feuds here on the Manningcast, but please take the opportunity to fire back if you'd like."</p><p>The trio then discussed the fact that&nbsp;Lawrence grew up looking up to Peyton before Eli revealed a rather unnerving photo of what Lawrence would like if he had the same hairdo as Peyton.</p><p>It's unlikely Lawrence will make this the 2023 version of 'The Trevor', but stranger things have happened.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on talkSPORT">Read More on talkSPORT</h2><p>For now, though, he has more serious matters to attend to.</p><p>Both Lawrence and the Jaguars will be hoping he can shake off his latest injury and return to action as soon as possible to help the team in their playoff push.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraGlma4N2fphoq6udpqS%2FbrjAsKmeppOaerS0zqurZqCRnr9utsCcoqynnqu2rbjEZqGan6WWv7R7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./richie-merritt-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-214609-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Richie Merritt Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a>
