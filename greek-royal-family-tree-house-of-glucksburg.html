However, with growing Republic sentiment in Greece, <strong>Constantine didn't return home until 1946 when a referendum was held, with the result being in favour of the monarchy</strong>.</p><p id=e0f_SoE2b2d data-wc=66><strong>Constantine became Crown Prince at the young age of just six&nbsp;</strong>following the death of his grandfather, George, in 1947. When he was nine, Constantine began being prepared for the throne and served in the Greek military when he turned 15. In his youth, Constantine was a keen sportsman and he managed to win a gold medal at the 1960 Olympic Games in the sailing event.</p><p id=eAxo4BRi3I- data-wc=68><strong>The royal was only 23 when he acceded to the throne</strong>, with his father dying of stomach cancer on 6 March 1964. However, Constantine headed to the throne at a time of great political unrest and his appointment of Georgios Athanasiadis-Novas as Prime Minister of Greece in 1965 following the resignation of Georgios Papandreou led to protests on the streets, which were only resolved by the 1967 elections.</p><p id=e9DEShaWa2i data-wc=59>In 1967, a military coup was launched leading to the formation of a new government, which was sworn in by Constantine. However, the Greek monarch <strong>organised a counter-coup months later, which ultimately failed, leading to the royal family fleeing Greece</strong>. Constantine was still King of Greece for six years until the junta abolished the monarchy on 1 June 1973.</p><p id=erYHhuVzIFu data-wc=52>When the junta fell the following a year, a referendum was held on restoring the monarchy, however, the Greek public voted resoundingly against this. The former King spent much of the rest of his life outside of the country, but caused headlines during a family holiday back to his homeland in 1993.</p><p id=eR-S95DLHJD data-wc=68>Constantine would later sue the Greek government following their seizing of his family's historic home and assets and a judgement from the European Court of Justice found in his favour in 2000.
