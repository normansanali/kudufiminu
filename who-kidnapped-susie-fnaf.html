Susie is the soul within Chica and Funtime Foxy (Books), as well as <b>one of the victims of William</b>.</span></span><h2>Is Chica possessed by Susie?</h2>"Chica" is Spanish for "girl" or "cutie". It's confirmed that Susie possessed Chica the Chicken both in the games and in the Fazbear Frights books.<h2>Who is Susie's dad FNAF?</h2>Susie Davies was born in Baltimore of Maryland, the daughter of David and Joan Davies, Susie's grandfather, Gerald was a WWII veteran, and Gerald dies of a stroke when Susie was six, only her dad and her mom takes care of her.<h2>Who was the first missing child in FNAF?</h2>During June 26th, long before the events of the first and second games and after the events of the fourth game, a total of five children presumably named Gabriel, Jeremy, Susie, Fritz and Cassidy went missing at the pizzeria.<h2>Does Susie have a sister FNAF?</h2>Susie is one of the protagonists of Coming Home, the third story in Fazbear Frights 4: Step Closer. She is one year older than her sister Samantha.<h2>FNAF 6 SECRET SPRINGBONNIE EASTER EGG</h2><p></p><h2>Who is Susie's mom FNAF?</h2>One year ago, Susie was lured away and murdered. Susie's tragic death broke her family apart, with her dad leaving, her mom, Patricia drugging herself and her sister, Samantha left in constant grief.<h2>Who Possesss Ballora?</h2>Ballora is one of two animatronics to be more aware of her surroundings and not seem to rely on pre-recorded lines like the more rudimentary animatronics. The other is Circus Baby after she is possessed by The Daughter.<h2>Who is Vanny?</h2>Vanessa, otherwise known as Vanny or the Reluctant Follower, is a human who follows the orders of Glitchtrap. She is the presumed main protagonist of Five Nights at Freddy's VR: Help Wanted. She is not seen directly, but is only heard through her mask in the game.<h2>Who is Freddy possessed by?</h2>Freddy Fazbear: The original incarnation of Freddy who appeared in the first Five Nights at Freddy's game. He is an animatronic brown bear who is possessed by the ghost of a murdered child named Gabriel, who is also one of the Missing Children.<h2>Who is Foxy possessed by?</h2>It was originally implied the endoskeleton with silver eyes was presumably Foxy's as mentioned in Silver Eyes, but the final novel, The Fourth Closet, reveals that it was Circus Baby's endoskeleton.<h2>What is Susie's dog name FNAF?</h2>Fandom. Is Mangle Susie's Dog? I heard about this theory that Mangle was Susie's dog,but reanimated by William Afton after the dog got ran over a car, turning it into an animatronic via Mangle,so what do you think about it?<h2>How did Susie become Chica?</h2>First Pizzeria<p>After that he lured four more children (Gabriel, Fritz, Jeremy, Cassidy) into a safe room where he brutally murdered them and hid their bloodied corpses inside soon-to-be-released animatronics, including Chica, who got Susie stuffed into her.</p><h2>Is mangle a dog?</h2>from the books we also know that William Afton was experimenting with Remnant this dog, mangle was the first successful experiment. for example, we know that all of the animatronics apart from mangle possess human like noises.<h2>Why did Chica say I was the first?</h2>Trivia. One of Chica's lines in Ultimate Custom Night is "I was the first. I have seen everything". This implies her child was the first to be killed in the Missing Children's Incident.<h2>Why does Chica remove her beak?</h2>From what I know, her beak is too small and so she can't open her mouth wide, so she takes off her beak. It's unknown where she places her beak, though.<h2>Who is Toy Bonnie possessed by?</h2>It is heavily hinted that Toy Bonnie is possessed by a murdered child.<h2>Is Vanny Vanessa?</h2>Well, the short answer is no, Vanny and Vanessa are not the same people While Vanessa is a good character in the game, Vanny is the main antagonist of FNAF Security Breach. She has a white bunny costume, which gives her quite a scary appearance.<h2>Who is the villain in FNAF?</h2>William Afton, better known as the Purple Guy among many other names, is the main antagonist of the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise.<h2>Who possesses withered Chica?</h2>Withered Chica is the same animatronic as Chica, just older and worse for wear, and so she is still possessed by Susie.<h2>How did Vanny become Vanny?</h2>The name Vanny seems to be a portmanteau of Vanessa and Bunny, a fact called out by Glamrock Freddy if the player discovered Vanny's hideout in FazerBlast. While some people believe that to be evidence for Vanessa being Vanny, others see it as too shallow of a connection as the name is too incriminating for Vanessa.<h2>Who is Vanny unmasked?</h2>After Freddy sacrifices himself to send Vanny plummeting her demise, Gregory unmasks her to discover that, surprise, surprise, Vannesa is the one beneath the mask.<h2>Is Vanny William Afton?</h2>Vanny is the fourth human character in the franchise to have merchandise based on her, the other three being the 8-bit McFarlane toys of William Afton, the Brother, and the Crying Child/Bite Victim. She's the only one of the four that isn't 8-bit.<h2>Is Ballora friendly?</h2>Handunit describes Ballora as a kind and child-friendly animatronic who encourages children to exercise as well as eat pizza. The player is instructed by Handunit to check on Ballora using the light on the left side of the office the player is in.<h2>Is Ballora Aftons wife?</h2>Scott basically just confirmed that Ballora is Mrs. Afton.<h2>Who is nightmare Ballora?</h2>Nightmare Ballora is an antagonist in Baby's Nightmare Circus. She is the nightmare form of Ballora from Sister Location.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahpmajmZm7orzPnptmq6WotqZ5xaeYnw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./will-janowitz-martial-status.html>&#171;&nbsp;All About Will Janowitz Martial Status</a>
