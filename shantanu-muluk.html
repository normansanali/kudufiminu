Reports indicate that the document was produced by Indian activists Disha Ravi, Shantanu Muluk, and Nikita Jacob to spread disaffection and tension toward Indian secularity[1]NDTV.</p><p>Disha Ravi, the key accused of the infamous Toolkit case, was arrested in February 2021. However, a non-bailable warrant was released against Shantanu and Nikita days later to be guilty of editing and producing the Toolkit document and being in direct contact with the Pro-Khalistani elements. However, according to recent media updates, Shantanu Muluk has been granted transit bail by Justice Vibha Kankanwadi of the Bombay High Court for about ten days to allow him to apply for the defense before the court in Delhi[3]India Today.</p><p>Muluk, in his plea to the High Court of Bombay, argued that his intention to help the Farmer’s protest was Bona Fide. He also said he was helping the real dissidents (farmers) to support them in their plea. He further argued that the case brought against him under section 153-A (promoting enmity between different communities) breaches legal provisions in a democratic republic to lift a voice against legitimate dissent.</p><h2>Protests for the release of Shantanu Muluk</h2><p>After many anticipations, Justice Kankanwadi granted Shantanu Muluk transit bail, which relieved him of the need to seek justice in a court of law in Delhi. In its order, the Bombay High Court also stated an amount of Rs. 50,000 as a personal bond would be released in the name of Shantanu Muluk if he had been arrested in the Toolkit case before the duration of bail had ended[4]India Today.</p><h2>Shantanu Muluk Career</h2><p>Sources indicate that Shantanu Muluk is an aerospace engineer who has quit his job as a full-time activist to concentrate on social issues and raise consciousness among people to fight for their rights.</p><p>We couldn’t find any updates on his future.
