While lots of athletes and celebrities invest their money, James has gone above and beyond with his massive stakes.

That story gets mixed up with the true story of LeBron turning down a game-changing McDonald's endorsement.</p><p>According to Sportscasting, LeBron turned down a $15 million contract in an early part of his career. At the time, it would have been the biggest fast-food endorsement in history in terms of money involved.

Perhaps Kevin Durant or Steph Curry could, but Lebron was the obvious fill-in for this generation.</p><p>Many fans have been curious as to what King James would invest in regarding basketball. While LeBron can't invest in an NBA team as he's still a player, if his net worth continues to increase, he could easily own a team. George Halas, Michael Jordan, and Derek Jeter are examples of superstar athletes or coaches owning a team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to LeBron himself, he wants to skip coaching and broadcasting in order to outright own a team.
