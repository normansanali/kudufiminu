Capone was a member of the Five Points Gang and eventually became the boss of the Chicago Outfit. He gained notoriety during the Prohibition era, where he expanded bootlegging through violent means while maintaining relationships with city officials.</p><p>Capone’s reign as crime boss came to an end when he went to prison for tax evasion in 1932. He served nearly eight years of his 11-year prison sentence before being released due to his failing health in 1939. Capone was responsible for the Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre, which led to influential citizens demanding governmental action.</p><p>Al Capone has been featured in popular culture with films such as “Al Capone,” “The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre,” and “Capone,” and the television series, “The Untouchables.” Capone died at the age of 47 after suffering a stroke and cardiac arrest in January 1947.</p><h2><span id=Al_Capones_Net_Worth_at_the_Peak_of_His_Power>Al Capone’s Net Worth at the Peak of His Power</span></h2><p>At the height of his power, Al Capone’s empire was generating $60 million from illegal alcohol, $25 million from his gambling business, $10 million in vice, and another $10 million from various other ventures. His personal income was $105 million per year, equivalent to $1.5 billion per year in today’s rates.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Family>Early Life and Family</span></h2><p>Al Capone was born in Brooklyn, New York, on January 17, 1899. His parents, Teresa and Gabriele, were Italian immigrants. Capone had eight siblings, including Salvatore and Raffaele, who both became involved in his criminal empire. Sadly, one of his siblings, Ermina, passed away at just 1 year old. Capone attended Catholic school but was expelled at age 14 for striking a teacher in the face. He then found work at a bowling alley and a candy store and played semi-professional baseball for two years.</p><h2><span id=Al_Capones_Criminal_Career>Al Capone’s Criminal Career</span></h2><p>Al Capone started his criminal career by joining small-time gangs in New York, including the Junior Forty Thieves and Bowery Boys, before becoming a member of the powerful Five Points Gang. He worked as a bouncer at a saloon in Chicago and became the right-hand man of James “Big Jim” Colosimo, who was later murdered, leading to Capone’s rise to power. During Prohibition, he smuggled liquor into the United States with the help of Canadian bootleggers. Capone survived several assassination attempts, and his involvement in the murders of Assistant State Attorney William H. McSwiggin, Frankie Yale, and chief investigator Ben Newmark was reported by “The New York Times.” He was suspected of ordering the Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre, which resulted in the deaths of seven people, but he was not charged. Capone was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon in Philadelphia and sentenced to a year in prison. He was later convicted of income tax evasion and spent time in federal prison, where he was diagnosed with gonorrhea and syphilis. Capone died in 1947 at the age of 48.</p><h2><span id=Al_Capones_Marriage_and_Family_Life>Al Capone’s Marriage and Family Life</span></h2><p>Al Capone married Mary Josephine Coughlin, known as Mae, on December 30, 1918, and they remained together until his death. They had a son named Albert Francis “Sonny” Capone on December 4, 1918, and named Johnny Torrio, Capone’s mentor, as the godfather. Sonny did not follow his father’s illegal activities and pursued a career as a used car salesman, apprentice printer, and tire distributor. Sonny legally changed his name to Albert Francis Brown in 1966. Capone had extramarital affairs during his marriage to Mae, and she warned Sonny not to follow in his father’s footsteps.</p><h2><span id=Al_Capones_Health_and_Death>Al Capone’s Health and Death</span></h2><p>On November 16, 1939, Al Capone was released from prison due to his deteriorating health. He was initially turned away from Baltimore’s Johns Hopkins Hospital but was eventually treated for his neuropsychiatric disorder at Union Memorial Hospital. Capone then moved to Palm Island, Florida, in March 1940, where he was one of the first people in America to be treated with penicillin in 1942.</p><p>In 1946, Capone’s doctor and a psychiatrist concluded that he had “the mentality of a 12-year-old child.” Capone suffered a stroke on January 21, 1947, but began to improve after regaining consciousness. However, he contracted bronchopneumonia and went into cardiac arrest on January 22nd. Al Capone passed away at his Palm Island home on January 25th due to apoplexy causing his heart to fail. A private funeral was held in Chicago, and he was buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery. His remains, along with those of his father and brother Salvatore, were moved to Hillside, Illinois’ Mount Carmel Cemetery in 1950.</p><h2><span id=Capones_Miami_Beach_Mansion_Sells_for_1075_Million>Capone’s Miami Beach Mansion Sells for $10.75 Million</span></h2><p>In 1928, Al Capone purchased a 6,077 square foot mansion in the Palm Island area of Miami Beach for $40,000. The home, which sits on a 30,000 square foot lot, was sold by Capone’s widow in 1952. Recently, the seven-bedroom, five-bathroom home was sold for $10.75 million in September 2021.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCty2aamqifo7JuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./all-titan-types-in-attack-on-titan.html>&#171;&nbsp;All Titan Types In Attack On Titan</a>
