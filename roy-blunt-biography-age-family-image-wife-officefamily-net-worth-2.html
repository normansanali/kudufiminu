Neither bill passed.</p><p>Blunt voted against two Democrat-sponsored bills, both which also did not pass, including one that would have made background checks required for online gun sales and gun sales at gun shows and another that would have not allowed anyone on the terrorist watchlist to purchase a gun.</p><p>In response to the&nbsp;2017 Las Vegas shooting, Blunt stated that he was “saddened by the tragic loss of life” and offered his thoughts to the victims.</p><h4><span id=Health_policy class=mw-headline>Health policy</span></h4><p>The Wall Street Journal reported on February 2011 that “Blunt introduced an amendment to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that would allow an employer to deny health services if they conflict with their ‘religious beliefs or moral convictions’.”</p><p>He said of the amendment, ” as it an overreach when Mrs.&nbsp;Clinton&nbsp;put it in the&nbsp;Clinton health care plan&nbsp;in 1994? I don’t think it’s an overreach at all. It doesn’t mention any specific procedure. It doesn’t even suggest the mandate should be eliminated.”</p><p>In 2012, he proposed the “Blunt Amendment,” which would have amended the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) provision that requires all insurance plans to cover the birth control pill to allow moral and religious objectors to opt-out of birth control coverage. The amendment was ultimately defeated.</p><p>In July 2013, Blunt indicated that he would not support efforts to tie raising the federal debt ceiling to defund Obamacare. In an interview on MSNBC, he expressed his opinion that Obamacare is “destined to fail”, but that raising the debt ceiling shouldn’t be “held hostage” to “any specific thing”.</p><p>In 2016, Senators Blunt and&nbsp;Patty Murray&nbsp;(D-WA) co-sponsored a successful $2 billion funding increase for the&nbsp;National Institutes of Health, the first such research increase in over a decade.</p><h4><span id=National_security class=mw-headline>National security</span></h4><p>He supported President Donald Trump’s 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail Muslim immigration until better screening methods are devised. He stated ” Trump is doing what he told the American people he would do.</p><p>I would not support a travel ban on Muslims; I do support increased vetting on people applying to travel from countries with extensive terrorist ties or activity. These seven countries meet that standard. Our top priority should be to keep Americans safe.”</p><h4><span id=Social_Security_and_Medicare class=mw-headline>Social Security and Medicare</span></h4><p>Blunt has argued for the need to reduce fraud and waste in Medicare and Social Security.&nbsp;He has spoken out for the need to reform entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security.</p><h4><span id=Trade class=mw-headline>Trade</span></h4><p>He has been a supporter of free-trade agreements. The Springfield News-Leader wrote: ” Blunt has supported a spate of free-trade agreements during his nearly 20 years in Congress, including a U.S-Singapore deal in 2003, the Central American Free Trade agreement in 2005 and the U.S-Korea agreement in 2011.” After early enthusiasm, Blunt has been ambivalent about supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=roy-blunt-wife></span>Roy Blunt Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Roy has been married twice until now.
