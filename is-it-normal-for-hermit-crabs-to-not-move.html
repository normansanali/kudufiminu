The final cause could be impending death. This could be a result of incorrect habitat conditions, incorrect food (nearly all hermit crab food sold in retail stores is toxic) or PPS (post purchase stress). <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on crabstreetjournal.org</a><h2>Why is my hermit crab just sitting there?</h2>Another explanation is that she's getting ready to molt. Have you noticed any digging activity nearby? I've noticed that my crabs sit in a corner for a few days before they dig down to do a molt in that same spot. Really all you can do is wait. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on hermitcrabassociation.com</a><h2>How do I know if my hermit crab is dying or molting?</h2>If they have died, they will start to smell badly within a few days. A hermit crab may take up to two months to complete the entire molting process, so you will know far before that time whether or not they are still alive—and smaller crabs do not take nearly this long to complete the entire molting process. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on thesprucepets.com</a><h2>Is my hermit crab dead or sleeping?</h2>You can tell if a hermit crab is alive by gently tapping its shell or picking it up and observing its behavior. A live hermit crab will typically retract into its shell or move around. If the crab does not respond to gentle stimuli, it may be dead. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>How to Tell If a Hermit Crab Is Dead</h2><h2>How do I know if my hermit crab is sad?</h2>The very first sign of depression in crabs is lethargy.

Hermit crabs can become stressed by bullying, extreme hot or cold temperatures, loneliness, or overcrowding. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on webmd.com</a><h2>What does a hermit crab do when it dies?</h2>If your hermit crab dies, it will begin to decompose – and its carcass will begin to smell putrid. If you can't smell anything, pick the crab out of the tank to get a closer whiff.

However, all of this overeating usually takes place at night when you're asleep so you likely won't see it. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on thesprucepets.com</a><h2>Why hasn't my hermit crab moved in weeks?</h2>If he hasn't moved in a few weeks, he is most likely not molting, which is a natural process that hermit crabs go through to grow and shed their old exoskeletons. Molting crabs usually stay buried under the substrate and do not emit any odor. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on justanswer.com</a><h2>Do hermit crabs stop moving when they molt?</h2>The legs appear to be lifeless and very limp with a slight curl. When they lie on their side and are ready to shed their exoskeleton , they come most of the way out of their shells, only keeping the very tip of their tail within the shell. At this time, the hermit crab appears to be lifeless. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on crabstreetjournal.org</a><h2>Why is my hermit crab not moving after molting?</h2>Hermit crabs periodically shed their exoskeleton, and this process often involves losing body parts.

They are most active during the night and they truly love the dark. As a hermit crab grows, it molts, shedding its exoskeleton and creating a new, larger one. A crab builds up enough water pressure in its body to split the old skin. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on sfzoo.org</a><h2>Do hermit crabs go days without eating?</h2>They do eat but very little and can go several days up to two weeks without food.
